This repository demonstrates a common type error that can occur in TypeScript when passing arguments of the wrong type to a function. The bug.ts file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.ts shows the corrected version.  The issue arises from type mismatches in the function call. The function `add` expects two numbers but receives a number and a string as arguments.  The solution demonstrates how to use type checking to prevent such errors and improve the robustness of your TypeScript code.
